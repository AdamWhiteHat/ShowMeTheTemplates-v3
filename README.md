# Show Me The Templates!
## Version 3.0

Show Me The Template is a tool for exploring the templates, be their data, control or items panel, that comes with the controls built into WPF for all 6 themes.

Show Me The Templates! was originally created by by [Chris Sells & Ian Griffiths](https://sellsbrothers.com/2091) as part of their book, [Programming WPF](https://sellsbrothers.com/wpfbook).

The primary difference with this version (I call it version 3.0) is some UX improvements. I found the UI klunky and it bothered me, so I set out to make it behave more to my liking. As it turns out, this was no easy feat, and there was probably a reason the original developers published it the way it was. No matter, after beating my head against the desk with tenatious persistance, I finally got it to do what I wanted.

The XAML viewer control on the right hand side now expands to fill the available space, the XAML controls expand as large as they need to display the full XAML, and the panel containing all the XAML source controls is a unified scrolling panel (instead of each template XAML text block scrolling independently, which was annoying).
